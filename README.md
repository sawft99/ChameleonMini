## B. Crash Course

### B1. Detect Keys and Upload Card files
---

#### 1. Obtain and Prepare Tools:

  1. Tools:
      - Optional GUI
      - Terminal APP
      - Phone APP

   2. Connect to the Chameleon Mini or Tiny using the APP
      - Connect via USB or Bluetooth

   - Note:
      - Both the Chameleon Mini and Tiny support direct connection to the mobile phone USB port
         - For the Mini, an additional OTG adapter needs to be purchased
         - Tiny uses its own dual-headed TYPE-C data cable to connect directly to TYPE-C mobile phones
      - Chameleon Mini has built-in Bluetooth BLE4.0. Press any button to wake up Bluetooth
      - Turn Bluetooth `ON` on your phone and the APP will automatically connect

#### 2. Use APP to Enable Detection Mode:

   1. After connecting, click on a single card slot and select `MF_DETECTION_1K` or `MF_DETECTION_4K` in the `Card Slot` mode
   2. This card slot will now have the `Detection` mode turned `ON`
   3. Write the original card number in the `UID Card Number` column
      - If you don't know the UID number, you can fill in it at will
   4. Then click the `Clear` button below to clear the last detection record

#### 3. Use APP to Get Keys:

   1. Take the Chameleon to the access control reader and swipe it across 
   2. The key and access traces are recorded by the Chameleon when you swipe
   3. Connect back to the mobile phone and press the `Crack` button
   4. After a few seconds, the APP will automatically solve and list the results, as shown in the figure below:
   
<a href="https://ibb.co/Q6xcVkW"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Q6xcVkW/Untitled-1.png" alt="Untitled-1" border="0"></a>

   5. The list shows which blocks the read head just visited, and what password was used for each access
   6. Click the `History` button. The APP will automatically list the keys separately and save them for other software to use
   7. If your mobile phone comes with an NFC function, you can put the original key directly on the mobile phone
   8. The APP will automatically use the key in the list to read the entire card, and after it is successful, it will automatically save the entire card data file on the mobile phone

   - Note: 
      - Multiple red LEDs are on at the same time during detection, which means the memory is full, just clear the memory.

#### 4. Use APP to Import Existing Card Files:

   1. Use QQ to send the card data file to the mobile phone QQ
      - Or connect the mobile phone to the computer and transfer the file to any directory on the mobile phone
   2. Open the APP and click the `Dump` column
   3. Click the `Scanner` in the plus sign in the upper right corner
   4. Click the three horizontal line buttons in the upper left corner and select this phone
   5. Select the root directory of the QQ receiving file or the previously copied directory, and click `Allow Access`
   6. All card data files will be automatically scanned into the `Dump` file interface, which can be uploaded or edited at will
   7. Click the card data file in the `Dump` column below, and click `Upload` below to upload to the card slot corresponding to the Chameleon

### B2. Introduction to UID Mode and SAK Mode
---

#### 1. UID Mode:

   1. Click the button `UID Changeable (GEN1a)` in the APP or directly send the command `UIDMODE = 1` to turn it `ON`
      - `UIDMODE = 0` to turn it `OFF`
   2. After the UID mode is turned `ON`, the card simulated by Chameleon will become a GEN1a card
      - Commonly known as a UID card or Chinese magic card
   3. The current card slot takes effect

#### 2. SAK Mode:

   1. Click the `SAK Mode` button in the APP or directly send the command `SAKMODE = 1` to turn it `ON`
      - `SAKMODE = 0` to turn it `OFF`
   2. After the `SAK Mode` is turned `ON`, the card will feedback the real SAK value when it is found
   3. The SAK value is determined by the 0 sector, 0 block, and the position is the position of the sixth byte immediately after the UID number
   4. If the `SAK Mode` is not turned on, the SAK is a fixed value of 08, and 0 blocks of data are ignored
      - This function is useful when special SAK values cannot be used normally after being copied
      - This achieves better compatibility
   5. The current card slot takes effect
